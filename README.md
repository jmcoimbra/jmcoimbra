### Hi, I’m Juliano 👋  

👨‍💻 I manage humans, systems, and occasionally chaos  
🧩 I like Kanban, automation, and strong coffee pipelines  
🌍 Remote-first believer | ☕ Brazilian caffeine enthusiast  
💡 Building predictable systems and unpredictable ideas  
⚙️ Obsessed with systems that behave better than humans on Mondays  

💼 Currently @ Thanx — where we build loyalty without losing ours.  
📈 Mission: Stability, predictability, and the occasional miracle.  

#### What I actually do:
- Help engineers do their best work without burning out  
- Translate between product, devs, and reality  
- Pretend to understand why CircleCI failed again  

🎯 **Strategic goals:**  
- Communicate business impact (without a 40-slide deck)  
- Influence without authority (it’s basically Jedi work)  
- Be assertive… but with empathy (most days)  

> “I don’t fix bugs anymore. I fix processes that create bugs.”  
> “Kanban is my love language.”  

🥇 **Motto:** “If it moves, automate it. If it doesn’t, make it a Jira card.”
