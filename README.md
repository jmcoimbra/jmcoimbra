### Hi, I’m Juliano 👋  

👨‍💻 I manage humans, systems, and occasionally chaos.  
🧩 I believe in Kanban, automation, and strong coffee pipelines.  
🪄 My superpower: making “non-blocking updates” sound exciting in meetings.  

💼 Currently @ Thanx — where we build loyalty without losing ours.  
📈 Mission: Stability, predictability, and the occasional miracle.  

> “I don’t fix bugs anymore. I fix processes that create bugs.”
